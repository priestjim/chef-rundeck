chef-rundeck
============

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/priestjim/chef-rundeck/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/priestjim/chef-rundeck)

This is a Chef cookbook for the remote administration tool [Rundeck](http://rundeck.org). It installs the Rundeck
package (either on deb or rpm format) and configures various aspects of the software.

The latest and greatest revision of this cookbook will always be available
at https://github.com/priestjim/chef-rundeck

Requirements
============

Cookbooks
---------

The following cookbooks are direct dependencies because they're used
for common "default" functionality.

* java
* apt
* yum
* logrotate

In order to install the Chef discovery service, you'll need the `supervisor`
cookbook.

In order to install the NGINX proxy site, you'll either need the `openresty` or
`nginx` cookbook.

Platform
--------

The following platforms are supported and tested using Vagrant 1.2:

* Ubuntu 12.04
* CentOS 6.4

Other Debian and RHEL family distributions are assumed to work.

Chef Server
-----------

The cookbook converges best on Chef installations >= 10.18.2

Attributes
==========

Attributes are split in files semantically:

## default.rb

* `node['rundeck']['deb_version']` - The Rundeck version to be installed for Debian-based distributions.

* `node['rundeck']['rpm_version']` - The Rundeck version to be installed for RPM-based distributions.

* `node['rundeck']['node_name']` - The Rundeck node name. Defaults to `node.name`

* `node['rundeck']['url']` - The URL that Rundeck will be running on. Change it if you're running it over a reverse proxy.

* `node['rundeck']['hostname']` - The hostname Rundeck servers from.

* `node['rundeck']['port']` - The port Rundeck HTTP server runs on.

* `node['rundeck']['logging_level']` - The default logging level for Rundeck.

* `node['rundeck']['authentication']['file']` - The default authentication file to use for rundeck profile.

* `node['rundeck']['authentication']['name']` - The default authentication name to use for rundeck profile.

* `node['rundeck']['stub_config_files']` - The default rundeck stub config files.  These may need to be configured by a wrapper cookbook so overriding this value to remove the files your wrapper cookbook manages is the desired usecase.

  proxy virtual host.

Recipes
=======

## default.rb

The `default` recipe will install the official Rundeck package for your specific distribution and install various
configuration files needed for Rundeck to operate. If you need SSL support, it would be better to use a reverse proxy for
this (such us NGINX or Apache2) since Rundeck's SSL support requires various complicated steps (all hail Java).

Log rotation of Rundeck's and Chef-Rundeck's logs is managed by a `logrotate` job.

The `default` recipe will install and enable either a SYSV-standard service for Redhat and Debian based distributions
or an Upstart service for Ubuntu installations.

The cookbook also needs a custom Rundeck user that will be used to execute remote jobs. You need to create the user before
installing Rundeck and then define a passwordless RSA SSH key for the user in this cookbook's properties.

All credentials used are retrieved from:

* An encrypted data bag if the `node['rundeck']['admin']['encrypted_data_bag']` attribute is enabled
* A simple data bag otherwise
* In case there is no data bag defined, administrative attributes are retrieved from node attributes

## chef.rb

The `chef` recipe will install the `chef-rundeck` gem using the Ruby bundled with the Chef omnibus package. That way, no
extra dependencies occur (i.e. rbenv or rvm or a packaged ruby).

Supervisor from the `supervisor` cookbook is used to start and supervise the service.

As with `default`, all credentials (Chef client key and client name) used are retrieved from:

* An encrypted data bag if the `node['rundeck']['admin']['encrypted_data_bag']` attribute is enabled
* A simple data bag otherwise
* In case there is no data bag defined, administrative attributes are retrieved from node attributes

## proxy.rb

The `proxy` recipe will install an NGINX configuration file that exposes Rundeck through a reverse proxy HTTP interface.

Data bag format
===============

The Rundeck cookbook requires some data to be available in data bags. Depending on the value of
`node['rundeck']['admin']['encrypted_data_bag']`, the data bag data will be loaded via encrypted data bag
methods or plain. You can select the data bag name and ID via the `node['rundeck']['admin']['data_bag']`
and `node['rundeck']['admin']['data_bag_id']` attributes. The following attributes must be present in the
selected data bag:

* `username`: Used as the default administrator's username created during the initial installation of Rundeck.
* `password`: Used the default administrator's password created during the initial installation of Rundeck.
* `ssh_key`: Used in place of the Rundeck SSH user's RSA private key.

If you are using the `rundeck::chef` recipe, the following must be present in the data bag too:

* `client_key`: The Chef client's private key in PEM format.
* `client_name`: The Chef client's name.

In addition to administrative attributes, data bags are used in mail recipient search. The search query searches among the
`node['rundeck']['mail']['recipients_data_bag']` data bag using a standard Chef query defined in
`node['rundeck']['mail']['recipients_query']` and from the results retrieves the field
defined in `node['rundeck']['mail']['recipients_field']` using standard Ruby eval.
So, if you are looking for the `user['notifications']['email']` field in your data bags
for your mail recipients, you should define it as:

    node['rundeck']['mail']['recipients_field'] = "['notifications']['email']"

LWRP
====

## user

This cookbook defines the `rundeck_user` LWRP. The LWRP can be used to create users
in Rundeck (see http://rundeck.org/docs/administration/authentication.html#realm.properties) through the standard
`realm.properties` file. Only MD5 and CRYPT encryption is supported as an encryption scheme, along with plain-text.

The following actions are supported:

* `create` - Creates a Rundeck user if it does not exist already.
* `update` - Updates a Rundeck user.
* `delete` - Removes a Rundeck user.

The following attributes are used in the LWRP:

* `name` - The actual Rundeck username.
* `password` - The password in plain text.
* `roles` - The Rundeck roles that this user is a member of.
* `encryption` - One of `crypt`, `md5`, `plain`.

Usage sample:

    rundeck_user 'ops' do
      password '123abc'
      encryption 'md5'
      roles %w{ user admin architect deploy build }
      action :create
    end

## plugin

This cookbook defines the `rundeck_plugin` LWRP. The LWRP can be used to install plugins in Rundeck
(see http://rundeck.org/docs/plugins-user-guide/index.html). Plugin installation is fairly straight-forward as
plugins can be installed/uninstalled just by moving/removing the plugin file
from the `libext` directory in Rundeck's home.

The following actions are supported:

* `create` - Installs a Rundeck plugin.
* `remove` - Removes a Rundeck plugin.

The following attributes are used in the LWRP:

* `name` - The plugin name. Plugin must end in `.jar` or `.zip` to be considered valid.
* `url` - The URL to fetch the plugin from.
* `checksum` - SHA-256 checksum of the plugin. Used in the same way as the `remote_file` resource.

Usage sample:

    rundeck_plugin 'rundeck-hipchat-plugin-1.0.0.jar' do
      checksum 'd7fea03867011aa18ba5a5184aa1fb30befc59b8fbea5a76d88299abe05aec28'
      url 'http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=com/hbakkum/rundeck/plugins/rundeck-hipchat-plugin/1.0.0/rundeck-hipchat-plugin-1.0.0.jar'
    end

Usage
=====

Include the recipe on your node or role. Modify the
attributes as required in a role cookbook to change how various
configuration variables are applied per the attributes section above.

If you need to alter the location of various cookbook_file
directives, use `chef_rewind`.
